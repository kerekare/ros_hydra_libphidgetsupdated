- \b "~stop_threshold" : \b [double] Distance to relevant_obstacle at which robot stops to move completely min: 0.0, default: 0.2, max: 5.0
- \b "~obstacle_damping_dist" : \b [double] Distance in driving direction at which potential field like slow down controller starts to work min: 0.1, default: 5.0, max: 5.0
